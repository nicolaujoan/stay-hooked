# stay-hooked
guided project to learn about react hooks

--- 
### HOOKS USED

- useState: managing simple state changes
- useEffect: handling side effects when first render or state changes
- useReducer: handling complex state updates when having related states
- useRef: have references to the DOM
- useForwardRef: interacting with a component imperatively
- useContext: avoid large prop chains
